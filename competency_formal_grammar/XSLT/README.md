# COMPETENCY GENERATION XSLT - PROCESS DOCUMENTATION

## The Input

### Competency sentence components (no scope filtering)
input file at: "competency_generation\competency_formal_grammar\XSLT\competency_components.xml"

### Scoped competency sentence components (@class)
This XML is just a test for now - will need more comprehensive and complete scope attribute values added:

input file at: "competency_generation\competency_formal_grammar\XSLT\test_attScopes_competency_components.xml"

## The XSLT generators


### No scope filtering:



### Scope filtering - xsl:key implementations:



### Running sentence component data through XSLT keyed to a single scope, for streamlined scope output

### Considerations

## XML output: 

scope collection structure:
    scope-name-collection/

## TSV generator: outputting tab-separated sentence text strings with XSLT

### xsl:result-document - separate output files for different kinds of sentence structures and scopes

## Final Data Implementation

OBJECT STRINGS:
- create subsets of objects that wouldn't occur together 



create separate xslt for each scope
- 

short term focus:

- complex scope

scopes we need:
- rational numbers
- real numbers 
- whole numbers
